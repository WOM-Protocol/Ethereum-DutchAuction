`WOMToken` is a next-generation decentralized Ethereum word of mouth marketing platform currently in alpha.

Unlike traditional marketing techniques, WOM rewards users and content creatures through the power of word of mouth.  WOM utilizes the power of Smart Contracts, to create a self-regulating decentralized network that rewards users based on mathematics, and not human judgement nor error.   

Contracts are written in `solidity` and built with the Ethereum framework `truffle`. This project is currently in production stage and is undergoing heavy work.
